This call for papers is now inactive and is only meant for reference/archival purposes.


#### Areas of interest

The primary focus areas of this workshop are the following:
1. **Differentiable computer vision** techniques, including, but not limited to, differentiable depth and pose estimation, feature extraction and matching pipelines, image filtering, pointset alignment, reconstruction pipelines, and their applications.
2. **Differentiable geometry processing and graphics tools**, including, but not limited to, differentiable mesh manipulation, rendering, higher-order light transport, and their applications.
3. **Differentiable physics simulation** methods, that innovate either at the implementation level (i.e., differentiable reparameterizations of contact, articulated bodies, collisions, etc.) or the application level (policy learning, representation learning, physics-informed neural network design, etc.).
4. **Applications and limitations** of differentiable methods. Differentiable physics allows for more efficient model predictive control and system identification. Differentiable graphics and rendering might allow for more accurate novel viewpoint synthesis. However, there are also limitations: for example, gradients are not always useful in contact-rich or long-horizon manipulation tasks. Furthermore, differentiable methods are often applicable only where precise process models are available. How can differentiable methods be combined with gradient-free optimization (or other techniques) to circumvent these issues?
5. **Multi-disciplinary efforts** that integrate differentiable techniques from two or more of the above areas. This is a key area for the workshop. Examples include, but are not limited to, physics-aware visual representation learning, learning intuitive physics from videos, learning inverse graphics from images/videos.

A few representative publications in the interest areas of the workshop are listed in our [references](/references/).


#### Submission instructions

We invite **short papers** of upto **4 pages** (excluding references) in the areas listed above. Submissions will undergo a double-blind reviewing process and thus need to be appropriately anonymized. Additionally, submissions may use upload additional supplementary materials (appendices, code, videos, etc.). Looking at the supplementary materials is at the sole discretion of the reviewers. Submissions must follow the [workshop template](neurips_2020.sty). The workshop is **non-archival**: papers/abstracts accepted to the workshop will not appear in any formal proceedings. However, the papers, talks, and other materials (if any) will be posted on the workshop webpage to maximize visibility. Submissions that are currently under review or that have been recently accepted to a conference other than Neurips 2020 are permitted. All accepted papers will be presented in our virtual poster session and highlighted by a short, oral introduction (lightning talk). A select few promising, original contributions will be chosen for longer oral presentation.

For any queries or concerns about any aspect of the workshop, please do not hesitate to contact the organizers.


#### Early submission mentorship track

Our call for papers includes an early-submission mentorship track that pairs authors with experienced researchers who have committed to providing meaningful feedback to help polish papers for general submission. This program facilitates a private dialogue between the mentee and mentor with the goal of fostering an inclusive and supportive research community.

Paper submissions to the mentorship track are to be true drafts with at least 80% of work completed. Mentors are expected to provide a timely initial review of the draft submission and are encouraged to continue to engage with the mentee as they prepare for their final submission.

Please complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ky6Et26ODf6IIgJwYcA22cWQVwUGUrjNBCR85eSrFiE/viewform?edit_requested=true) if you are interested in becoming a mentor for our 2020 NeurIPS workshop. If selected, we'll let you know your mentee matches by the week of October 29.
